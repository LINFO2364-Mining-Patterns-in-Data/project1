"""
Skeleton file for the project 1 of the LINGI2364 course.
Use this as your submission file. Every piece of code that is used in your program should be put inside this file.

This file given to you as a skeleton for your implementation of the Apriori and Depth
First Search algorithms. You are not obligated to use them and are free to write any class or method as long as the
following requirements are respected:

Your apriori and alternativeMiner methods must take as parameters a string corresponding to the path to a valid
dataset file and a double corresponding to the minimum frequency.
You must write on the standard output (use the print() method) all the itemsets that are frequent in the dataset file
according to the minimum frequency given. Each itemset has to be printed on one line following the format:
[<item 1>, <item 2>, ... <item k>] (<frequency>).

The items in an itemset must be printed in lexicographical order. However, the itemsets themselves can be printed in
any order.

Do not change the signature of the apriori and alternative_miner methods as they will be called by the test script.
